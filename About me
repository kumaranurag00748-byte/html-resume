Hi, I’m Anurag—a curious mind fueled by code, captivated by nature, and always chasing meaning through music and philosophy. I’m currently immersed in tech, sharpening my skills with the precision of a coder and the discipline of a future civil servant. My goal? To transition from the digital world to public service as an IAS officer, where I can channel my ambition into impact.

I’m known for being hardworking, punctual, and relentlessly focused. Whether it’s debugging a stubborn line of code or dissecting a philosophical paradox, I bring intensity and purpose to everything I do. And yes, I take pride in my glorious mane—it’s not just hair, it’s a statement.
